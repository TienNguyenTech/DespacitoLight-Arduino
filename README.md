# 🎵 Arduino Despacito LED Blinker

This project makes an LED blink in sync with the beat of *Despacito* using an Arduino board. It’s a fun and interactive way to practice Arduino programming and explore the basics of timing and rhythm in embedded systems.

## ✨ Features
- Syncs LED blinking with the *Despacito* beat.
- Uses **delay()** or **millis()** for accurate timing.
- Simple and beginner-friendly Arduino project.
- Easily customizable for different songs.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Arduino board** (Uno, Nano, or compatible)
- **LED** (any color)
- **Resistor** (220Ω recommended)
- **Jumper wires**
- **Breadboard**

## 🔧 Setup
1. Connect the LED to **pin 13** (or any digital pin) of the Arduino.
2. Attach a **220Ω resistor** between the LED and ground.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your board.

## 📜 Code Example
```cpp
int ledPin = 13;
void setup() {
    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(500);  // Adjust timing for Despacito beat
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    delay(300);
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works
- The **LED blinks** following the beat pattern of *Despacito*.
- You can modify the `delay()` values to fine-tune the timing.
- Advanced users can use **millis()** for better precision.

## 🎛️ Customization
- Change the `ledPin` value to use a different pin.
- Adjust the `delay()` values to sync with another song.
- Add more LEDs for a **light show effect**.
