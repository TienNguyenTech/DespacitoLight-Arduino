# ðŸŽµ Despacito LED Blinking

This Arduino project makes LEDs blink in sync with the rhythm of the song *Despacito*. The LEDs follow a pattern to simulate the beat of the song.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- 3 LEDs
- 3 Resistors (220Î©)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## âš¡ Wiring Diagram
| LED  | Pin |
|------|----|
| LED1 | 13 |
| LED2 | 12 |
| LED3 | 11 |

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Connect the LEDs to the Arduino according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the provided code to your Arduino board.
3. Watch as the LEDs blink to the *Despacito* beat!

## ðŸŽ¶ Example Pattern
- The LEDs blink in a sequence mimicking the syllables of *Despacito*.
- Example sequence: `LED1 â†’ LED2 â†’ LED3 â†’ Pause â†’ LED1 & LED2 â†’ LED3`.
- The timing can be adjusted to better match the rhythm.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Timing values can be adjusted to better match the songâ€™s tempo.
- Consider adding a piezo buzzer to play the melody along with the LED pattern.
